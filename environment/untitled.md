# Environment Strategy

One of the key tenants of DX@Scale is a simplified environment strategy which is based on this priniciples

* Any org should be able to be recreated using artifacts as well as the runbooks.
* Any development should be carried out in an individual scratchorg provisioned just for the feature/task in hand
* There will be no long lived continous integration environments
