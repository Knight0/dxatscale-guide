sfpowerscripts has been migrated as an Accenture supported/hosted open source project.

**Features:**

* We have been refactoring the internal implementation to support a sfdx cli plugin for ease of use in other CI/CD systems other than Azure Pipelines. Due to this the entire task versions have been updated and refactored to use the new structure
* The CI/CD pipelines of the program was rewritten to use lerna and support deploying of npm package

**Fixes:**
