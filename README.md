## Why DX@Scale? 

The introduction of Salesforce DX revolutionized ways of working with Salesforce. Introduction of a CLI, a development org and a package based development model ushered in modern development practices followed in other tech stacks to Salesforce. Large and complex programs have often suffered in the past due to lack of the right tooling/practices.  DX@Scale was established to promote these new '**best**' practices and innovation from the community \(such as open-source project, ideas\) to help Salesforce Developers achieve their business goals without reinventing the wheel every time.
